# Redis-Like-Caching-Service
Built a toy Redis clone on Python that's capable of handling basic commands like PING, SET and GET after establishing a connection between the client and the clone. This Redis clone also parses inputs into RESP (REdis Serialisation Protocol) to send and receive commands with a binary-safe protocol for client server communication.
